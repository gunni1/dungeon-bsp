# About
Use binary space partition to create dungeon maps represented by pixel images. 

The Idea came from the algorithm described [here](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/82066) 

# Usage
There is a simple webserver to play with parameters of the generator. 

- Build the generator locally using `make server`
- Exexute the `./bin/server`
- Open e.g. `http://localhost:3000/map?width=100&height=100&depth=3` in a browser of your choice and play with the parameter
